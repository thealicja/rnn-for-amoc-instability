# RNN for AMOC Instability 🌊

This project explores the use of **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** - specifically **Reservoir Computing (Echo State Networks)** - to detect and forecast tipping points in a simplified climate model representing the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**.

We aim to anticipate **transitions to transient chaos and eventual system collapse** in the AMOC by training machine learning models on synthetic time series data generated from a coupled physical model.

## 🔬 About the Model

The system is based on a **5-dimensional box model** inspired by **Van Veen (2000)** and **Cessi (1994)**. It couples:
- Chaotic dynamics (x, y, z) modeled after Lorenz-style systems
- Ocean **temperature (T)** and **salinity (S)** dynamics
- External forcing (e.g., freshwater input) affecting system stability

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The model is trained using:
- **Reservoir Computing (Echo State Networks)**
- Custom training loop in both **MATLAB** and **Python**
- Time series are generated across multiple bifurcation parameters
- Validation is performed via RMSE, prediction horizon, or error threshold

Key Features:
- Spectral radius scaling
- Multiple training trials (best-of strategy)
- Predictive generalization to unseen parameter regimes

## 🧠 Why Use Machine Learning If We Have the Equations?
While the underlying system is governed by known physical equations, training a recurrent neural network (RNN) offers key advantages:

Fast predictions without re-solving the ODE system

Generalization across bifurcation parameters

Early-warning capabilities by detecting precursor patterns of tipping

Real-time usability in potential monitoring systems

Efficiency for parameter sweeps, sensitivity analysis, or Monte Carlo runs

The RNN essentially learns to emulate the complex behavior of the system-including nonlinear transitions and provides a lightweight tool for forecasting and scenario exploration.
